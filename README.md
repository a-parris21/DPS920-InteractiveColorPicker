# Interactive Color Picker

## About
An interactive OpenCV application which displays a color palette on the screen and allows the user to select colors by touching the desired color with their hand. The selected color is then displayed in a designated region of the screen. Additionally, the user should be able to clear the current color selected and also display the names of colors. The app will generate messages in response to user color selections.

This project was built as part of the coursework for our Computer Vision class.
