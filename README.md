# Interactive Color Picker

### About
An interactive OpenCV application which displays a colour palette on the screen and allows the user to select colours by pointing at the desired colour with their hand. The selected colour is then displayed in a designated region of the screen. Additionally, the user should be able to clear the current colour selected and also display the names of colours.

This project was built as part of the coursework for our Computer Vision class.
